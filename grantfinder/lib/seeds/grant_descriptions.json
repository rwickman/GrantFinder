This evidence of readiness will be demonstrated through achievement of scientific milestones and feasibility requirements as proposed in the application. Achievement of these milestones will be necessary for transition to the UH3 Implementation Phase. UH3s will be awarded after administrative review of the UG3 milestones pending availability of funds. During the UH3 phase, Years 2-5, the revised multilevel intervention will be tested in a new, larger clinical trial, using an experimental or quasi-experimental study design.

The screening assays thus developed from this FOA are expected to build upon systems neurobiology and clinical neuroscience to enhance the scientific value of preclinical animal data contributing to a therapeutic development pipeline by assessing the impact of therapeutic targets and treatment candidates on neurobiological mechanisms of clinical relevance to mental illnesses. The objectives of the FOA will be accomplished by supporting basic and translational neuroscientists who are committed to improving the efficiency and scientific value of the therapeutic development pipeline by advancing the discovery of in vivo physiological and behavioral measures reflecting circuit engagement as tools for early phase target validation and therapeutic screening for mental illness treatment development. The efforts supported by this initiative focus on measures in animals as a first step in generating translational assay measures that are adaptable across early therapeutic screens in animals to evaluation in humans. As such, this FOA may be considered a prequel to build a suite of assays that are evaluated in future projects for coherence of assay performance between the preclinical species and healthy humans.

The stated theme, proposed research projects, and associated cores will inform the etiology, pathogenesis or treatment of PD; investigations on related synucleinopathies may be included if such studies directly address the identified PD research challenge. Requirements include 1) a minimum of three research projects; 2) research cores that are each essential to accomplish the aims of at least two proposed research projects, plus an Administrative Core; 3) a mission statement and plan for career enhancement of Center trainees and investigators; and 4) a plan for effective outreach, including dissemination of Udall Center research results, to the local patient and advocacy community.

Critical advances in the treatment of brain disorders in human populations are hindered by our lack of ability to monitor and manipulate circuitry in safe, minimally-invasive ways. Clinical intervention with novel cell and circuit specific tools will require extensive focused research designed to remove barriers to delivery of gene therapies. In addition to identification and removal of barriers, the need to specifically target dysfunctional circuitry poses additional challenges. Neuroscience has experienced an impressive influx of exciting new research tools in the past decade, especially since the launch of the BRAIN Initiative. However, the majority of these cutting-edge tools have been developed for use in model organisms, primarily rodents, fish and flies. These cutting-edge tools, such as viral delivery of genetic constructs, are increasingly adaptable to larger mammalian brains and more importantly are emerging as potential human therapeutic strategies for brain disorders. A pressing need to develop tools for use in large brains or those that are more directly relevant to the human brain is the focus of this initiative.

A mechanistic trial is defined as \"A study designed to understand a biological or behavioral process, the pathophysiology of a disease, or the mechanism of action of an intervention. \"Minimal risk\" means that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests. NIH-defined clinical trial applications that are neither mechanistic nor minimal risk will not be supported through this FOA. Large-scale clinical trials, human gene-transfer and stem cell therapy trials, and other complex or high resource- or safety-risk clinical trials are not appropriate for this FOA.

They can be tested in pre-clinical models and/or for the clinical manifestations of OUDs such as withdrawal, craving, relapse, or overdose. Applications may focus on the development of new chemical entities, new formulations of marketed medications available for other indications, or combinations of medications that hold promise for the treatment of OUDs and overdose. Through this FOA, NIDA seeks to fast-track the discovery and development of medications to prevent and treat OUDs or opioid overdose and to advance them in the FDA's drug development approval pipeline.

The over-arching goal of this National Insitute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke R25 program is to support educational activities that complement and/or enhance the training of a workforce to meet the nation\u2019s biomedical, behavioral and clinical research needs. To accomplish the stated over-arching goal, this FOA will support creative educational activities with a primary focus on research experiences, designed to foster the development of physicians as research scientists in areas relevant to the NINDS mission. The research experiences will prepare clinicians to successfully compete for individual NIH mentored career development awards, or where appropriate, independent research awards. This FOA will also support educational activities such that participants of the R25 are expected to attend and participate in an annual workshop specific to this FOA to present their work, discuss progress and plans towards transitioning to the next career stage and to network with other researchers and leaders in their fields. Such success will facilitate their transition from resident/fellow to physician-scientist, and will thus foster retention of a cadre of physician-scientists who will conduct research into the mechanisms of, etiology, and treatment of neurological diseases. NINDS invites applications from institutions/organizations to support programs that provide research education during residency and fellowship designed to prepare clinical residents and fellows for careers as physician-scientists.

The second phase, funded under the R33 mechanism, will provide up to three years of support to: (1) optimize the mechanisms or processes identified in the R61 phase through further modifications to the intervention, (2) study the integration of approaches that may affect the same underlying mechanisms or processes, or (3) further study the relationship between the intervention and the underlying mechanism of action with a relevant target population. This second R33 phase should also aim to provide preliminary evidence that the mechanisms or processes modulated by the interventions are associated with functional outcomes or clinical benefits for specific conditions or disorders. Subject to the availability of funds, transition from the R61 to the R33 phase of the award will be administratively reviewed and will be determined by successful completion of \u201cGo/No-Go Criteria\u201d that need to be clearly specified in the R61 phase application.

For the purposes of this FOA, the term State encompasses all eligible organizations as defined in Section 3. MFRPS The purpose of this FOA section is to advance efforts for a nationally integrated food safety system by assisting State manufactured food regulatory programs to achieve and maintain conformance with the most current version of the Manufactured Food Regulatory Program Standards (MFRPS). The MFRPS are intended to ensure that State manufactured food regulatory programs develop and maintain best practices for a high-quality regulatory program. Also, the program standards are intended to enhance food safety by establishing a uniform basis for measuring and improving the performance of manufactured food regulatory programs in the United States. Conformance with these program standards will help Federal and State programs better direct their regulatory activities at reducing foodborne illness hazards in plants that manufacture, process, pack, or hold foods. FPTF The purpose of this funding option is to establish and/or support a Food Protection Task Force responsible for promoting the integration of an efficient statewide human and animal food (HAF) protection system that maximizes the protection of the public health. These efforts would include: fostering communication, education, outreach, cooperation and collaboration within the states among federal, state, local, tribal and territorial HAF protection, public health, agriculture, and regulatory agencies, industry, academia, and consumers to initiate and/or support HAF protection activities to improve public health. RRT The purpose of this FOA section is to facilitate long-term improvements and innovation to the national integrated food safety system by unifying and coordinating federal/state/local HAF emergency response efforts including: 1) Strengthening the link among epidemiology, lab and environmental health/regulatory components; 2) Improving States' regulatory and surveillance HAF protection programs to include using Incident Command System (ICS)/National Incident Management System (NIMS) principles and a Unified Command structure to conduct integrated responses to all-hazards HAF emergencies, rapidly identifying and removing tainted food from commerce, and conducting root cause investigations to inform future prevention efforts; and 3) Addressing supporting components, such as training, data sharing, data analysis, communications, continuous process improvement, and development of best practices and other resources to support national capacity/capability development. Special Projects The purpose of this FOA section is to develop and implement special projects that support innovation and integration in a nationally Integrated Food Safety System (IFSS) using the MFRPS or RRT framework.

In particular, applicants should focus on how specific constituent biological processes at one level of analysis contribute to quantifiable properties at other levels, either directly or as emergent phenomena. Although not required, it is preferable that applications link at least three levels of analysis and include an emphasis on genetics. The projects under this FOA will develop novel methods, theories, and approaches through a CN team framework, bringing together highly synergistic inter/transdisciplinary teams from neuroscience and the orthogonal fields of the physical sciences (e.g., data/computational science, physics, engineering, mathematics). Successful teams will combine, expand upon, or develop conceptual frameworks and theoretical approaches, and build explanatory computational models that connect contiguous levels of analysis. Such frameworks, theories, and computational explanatory models should be validated through experimental approaches to elucidate biological underpinnings of complex behavioral (including cognitive and affective) outcomes in psychopathology. Additionally, a goal of this program is to advance research in CN by creating a shared community framework of resources which may be used by the broader research community to further research, as such, a successful team will be expected to have a robust plan for sharing data and other resources.

AHRQ seeks to support conferences that help to further its mission to produce evidence to make health care safer, higher quality, more accessible, equitable and affordable, and to work with HHS and other partners to make sure that the evidence is understood and used (http://www.ahrq.gov/funding/policies/foaguidance/index.html. The types of conferences eligible for support include: 1) Research Development - conferences where issues or challenges in the practice and delivery of health care are defined and a research agenda or strategy for studying them is developed; 2) Research design and methodology - conferences where methodological and technical issues of major importance in the field of health services research are addressed or new designs and methodologies are developed; 3) Dissemination and implementation - conferences where research findings and evidence-based information and tools are summarized, communicated and used by organizations and individuals that have the capability to use the information to improve the outcomes, quality, access to, and cost and utilization of health care services; and/or, 4) Research training, infrastructure and career development - conferences where faculty, trainees and students are brought together with stakeholders to develop, share or disseminate research products, experiences, curricula, syllabi, or training competencies. These types of conferences are not for the training of individuals in health services research. The applicant must clearly identify which type of conference is being proposed. AHRQ is especially interested in supporting conferences that demonstrate strategies that include plans for disseminating complementary conference materials and products beyond the participants attending the event. Regionally-based conferences are acceptable with the expectation that plans will be developed for national dissemination. Such strategies might include, but are not limited to, submitting articles for publication, posting information on a website, and seeking formal opportunities to discuss conference information with others.", "term_vector": ["ahrq", "conference", "grant", "programs", "r13", "agency", "for", "healthcare", "research", "and", "quality", "ahrq", "the", "and", "conditions", "stated", "in", "this", "announcement", "may", "differ", "those", "used", "by", "the", "where", "this", "funding", "opportunity", "announcement", "provides", "specific", "written", "guidance", "that", "may", "differ", "from", "the", "general", "provided", "in", "the", "grant", "application", "please", "follow", "the", "instructions", "in", "this", "also", "note", "that", "ahrq", "may", "have", "different", "page", "limits", "than", "nih", "the", "application", "research", "if", "this", "is", "the", "page", "limits", "indicated", "within", "the", "individual", "ahrq", "grants", "policy", "and", "information", "applicants", "regarding", "funding", "opportunity", "announcement", "procedures", "can", "be", "at", "summary", "the", "agency", "for", "healthcare", "research", "and", "quality", "ahrq", "its", "interest", "in", "supporting", "conferences", "through", "the", "ahrq", "single", "year", "multiple", "year", "conference", "grant", "programs", "ahrq", "seeks", "to", "conferences", "that", "help", "to", "further", "its", "mission", "to", "produce", "evidence", "to", "health", "care", "higher", "more", "equitable", "and", "and", "to", "work", "with", "hhs", "and", "other", "partners", "to", "make", "sure", "that", "the", "evidence", "understood", "and", "used", "the", "types", "of", "conferences", "eligible", "for", "support", "research", "development", "where", "issues", "or", "challenges", "in", "the", "practice", "and", "delivery", "of", "health", "care", "defined", "and", "research", "agenda", "or", "strategy", "for", "studying", "them", "is", "research", "design", "and", "methodology", "conferences", "where", "methodological", "and", "technical", "issues", "of", "major", "importance", "the", "field", "of", "health", "services", "research", "are", "addressed", "or", "new", "designs", "methodologies", "are", "dissemination", "and", "implementation", "where", "research", "findings", "and", "information", "and", "tools", "communicated", "and", "used", "by", "organizations", "and", "individuals", "that", "the", "capability", "to", "use", "the", "information", "to", "improve", "the", "access", "and", "cost", "and", "utilization", "of", "health", "care", "research", "infrastructure", "and", "career", "conferences", "where", "trainees", "and", "students", "brought", "together", "with", "stakeholders", "to", "share", "or", "disseminate", "or", "training", "these", "types", "of", "conferences", "are", "not", "for", "the", "training", "of", "individuals", "in", "services", "applicant", "must", "clearly", "identify", "which", "type", "conference", "is", "being", "is", "especially", "interested", "in", "supporting", "that", "demonstrate", "strategies", "that", "include", "plans", "for", "complementary", "conference", "materials", "and", "products", "beyond", "the", "attending", "the", "conferences", "are", "acceptable", "with", "expectation", "that", "plans", "will", "be", "developed", "for", "national", "strategies", "might", "but", "are", "not", "limited", "submitting", "articles", "posting", "information", "on", "and", "seeking", "opportunities", "to", "discuss", "conference", "information", "with"]}, "1151": {"description": "National Institutes of Health (NIH)The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to encourage small businesses to address the technological needs of the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP).

Simulation in health care serves multiple purposes. As a training technique, it exposes individuals and teams to realistic clinical challenges through the use of mannequins, task trainers, virtual reality, standardized patients or other forms, and allows participants to experience in real-time the consequences of their decisions and actions. The principal advantage of simulation is that it provides a safe environment for health care practitioners to acquire valuable experience without putting patients at risk. Simulation also can be used as a test-bed to improve clinical processes and to identify failure modes or other areas of concern in new procedures and technologies that might otherwise be unanticipated and serve as threats to patient safety. Yet another application of simulation focuses on the establishment of valid and reliable measures of clinical performance competency and their potential use for credentialing and certification purposes. The foremost aim of the announcement is to advance patient safety.
